Modern water-quality information
requires much more that a value and remark code to characterize the data.
The tools in this library focus on the "qw" class, which store the value and
the remark code, but also information about the reporting level, the units,
the methods of analysis analysis, and the analyte itself.\cr Some specialized
analytical tools for left-only censored data, requiring objects of class
"lcens" have been developed and are included in this library. Other
analytical tools for multiply- or any censored data are alos included.  The
tools include automatic conversion of "qw" data into the "best" (left-only or
multiply censored) format.\cr Need a general description of the tools by
group--a brief synopsis of the OFR.
